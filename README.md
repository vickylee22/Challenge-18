# Challenge-18 Blockchain with Python

## Background
You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies
In this challenge, you’ll use the following libraries:
  •	pandas
  •	streamlit
  •	dataclasses
  •	datetime
  •	typing
  •	hashlib

## Installation 
To install the Streamlit library, first activate your dev environment then run the following command:
> pip install streamlit

## Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
  1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded the Challenge.

  2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by using ```streamlit run pychain.py```.

  3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add Block" button. 

  4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu. 
  
  5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
